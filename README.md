Flappy Bird clone in Java (Uni. course project)

This project was made as an excercise project for the University course Basics of Object Oriented Programming in the early 2014.

Kaila Bird is a Flappy Bird clone made in Java using the basic graphic libraries (java.awt, JFrame). The objective is to keep the asterisk shaped character from hitting the Pirkka beer can shaped walls as long as possible. It even features an annoying theme song.
